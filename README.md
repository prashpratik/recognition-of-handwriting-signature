# ML18/19-2.17 Recognition of handwriting signature
The K-Means algorithm has been extended on university with a function recognition algorithm compatible with LearningAPI.
Additionally, to algorithm, also an application MouseGestureRecognition has be created.
All required artefacts can be found here: https://github.com/UniversityOfAppliedSciencesFrankfurt/LearningApi/tree/KMeans-branch/LearningApi

My task is to :
1. Analyze existing application, which basically capture mouse pointer movements and collects coordinates. Set of coordinates is learning set of mouse points as array of two-dimensional vectors.
2. Analyze and document how feasible is recognition of signature (function) by using of two-dimensional mouse coordinates.
3. Extend existing application by adding a time as a third component in the vector.
4. Analyze and document algorithm with time approach and compare it with previous results.
